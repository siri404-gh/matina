    post: 'I call this the getaway to the 4 elements - city, mountains, desert, beach...India truly has it all. Arriving in the most holy place in India, Varanasi opened my eyes to a whole new way of life. Indian legends believe that if you are cremated in this city, your soul goes directly into heaven. Amazed I watched, as the bodies of many deceased burnt over open flames right before my eyes. I bathed in the holy Ganga River, the waters here are said to cleanse away every impurity. The hussel and bussel of the Indian city never seises to amaze me, with the endless roar of traffic, busy people and street cows, the city never sleeps, but who cares when your tuk tuk driver is cool enough to let you drive his ride! The mountains up north of India were definitely a highlight, with many wellness workshops running all day long, and the hike across the mountain tops to the Dalai Lama temple and Tibetan monastery. Here, Hindu’s and Tibetan religious folks, including monks, live together and share the same space. And now, last but not least...how can I ever forget my dearest desert camel and Clancy chicken who accompanied me for an overnight safari in West India. We managed to get through the sand and rain storm over the night, and although it was a challenge, I’d do it all over again! Our camels walked us from one village to the next, we met so many lovely village locals along the way.It was a blessing to experience what a village school is like for a while, and to teach the children how to read my name on the board! Thank you dear India for your shades, you are among the most colourful of them all, but most of all, I will miss your delicious daily chai tea!',

    post: 'I began a hike in Austria not knowing what to expect. Locals discouraged me, they said that weather conditions weren\'t ideal, however I\'m glad I stuck to my guns, after all, nothing could compare to my Finnish nightmare of a hike...  4 hours later, tired and wet from the rain and snow, I am standing at the tops of the Austrian Alps stunned and breathless, looking down from one of Europe highest points with not another body in site, it was this period that I claimed mountain goat status! The land of great heights, coffee shops, wine, and musical talent, you raised famous artists such as Mozart, Schubert and more. Austria you have the power to motivate, inspire and strengthen. Thank you for what you do! ',

Your nightlife is out of this world, from the famous ruin bars, to SPARTY - the outdoor spa party, I have lived some of my fondest memories. Your locals are so helpful and friendly, I've felt so welcomed all along! I don't dare to not mention the lovely hospitality I received at the winery at the famous 'Valley of the Beautiful Woman'! Furthermore, your nature is so precious, lake Balaton has swept me off my feet, from exploring the natural surroundings, to taking dips in your fresh water (central Europe's largest lake). So many places to relax and appreciate true nature, including the phenomenal natural thermal lake Heviz, where you are swimming among gorgeous pink lily flowers. I could spend an eternity with you and never get enough...thank you dearly Hungary!! <3",

Your street art is a perfect example of the values you hold, embracing nature as you hold her up on a pedestal. Your respect for the land and its resources are obvious, as you live so humbly among all the beautiful surroundings. I will never forget your breathtaking views and the hikes up in the mountain with knee-high snow, and especially not the crazy toboggan ride down the ski slopes. Experiencing your funky night life was something unforgettable, not to mention the lovely encounters with your locals. I feel so blessed to have been welcomed so openly.
